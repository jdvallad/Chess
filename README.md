# Chess Engine / GUI
Hello everyone, this is my first fully fledged java program.
I was stuck at home with COVID for about a week so I decided to create this game.
# Requirements
To run this game, I suggest installing the latest java JDK.
Import all .jar files in the lib folder as well as the bin folder within lib.
# Thank you so much for your interest!
