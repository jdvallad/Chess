# Chess Engine / GUI
Hello everyone, this is my first fully fledged java program.
I was stuck at home with COVID for about a week so I decided to create this game.
# Requirements
To run this game, I suggest installing the latest java JDK, but you should be able to use older versions.
Also, you will need the core.jar file from processing as I used this as a library.
# Thank you so much for your interest!
